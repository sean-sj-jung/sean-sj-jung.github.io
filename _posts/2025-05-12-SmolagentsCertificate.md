### Building a General AI Assistant for Multimodal Tasks

This [repository](https://github.com/sean-sj-jung/smolagents_gaia_run) contains the code and implementation details for a Smolagent developed as part of the [Hugging Face Agents Course Hands-on Project](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit4/hands-on).

The objective is to build an AI agent capable of handling diverse tasks that involve multimodal input—such as video, audio, images, and text—and sometimes require advanced reasoning, including playing games like chess.

The agent is evaluated using a subset of the [GAIA benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12983), which provides a standardized framework for testing general AI capabilities across modalities.
