### Inference-Time Scaling (Test-Time Compute)
  
Inference-time scaling, or test-time compute, involves enhancing the performance of LLMs by increasing computational effort during the inference phase. This approach allows models to engage in more deliberate "thinking" processes, leading to significant improvements in complex tasks such as mathematical reasoning and coding. 
  
**Key Techniques:**
  
- Chain-of-Thought  Prompting: Encourages models to generate intermediate reasoning steps, mimicking a human-like thought process. This technique has been shown to improve performance on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning.
  
- Reflection: Enables models to self-assess and iteratively refine their responses. By analyzing and critiquing their initial outputs, models can identify errors and generate improved answers.
  
- Verifier Reward Models: Utilize reinforcement learning frameworks to guide the model's reasoning process. It rewards models by accuracy without employing a separate critic model.
