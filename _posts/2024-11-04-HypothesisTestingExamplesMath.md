## Hypothesis testing

Two sided tests are twice the one sided tests if:
- The test statistics under the null is symmetrically distributed

But:
- When testing a binomial distribution with small sample sizes, it is not symmetric unless n is large. 
- Bounded test statistics such as Chi-squared is inherently one-sided.
- When the null distribution is skewed, e.g. non-parametric, bayesian, or MLE-based with the non-Gaussian null.

### Compute p-value from scratch

Let $$ T $$ be a test statistic, and let $$ t_{\text{obs}} $$ be its observed value from the sample.  

- One-sided (e.g., $$ H_1: \mu > \mu_0 $$): $$ \text{p-value} = P_{H_0}(T \geq t_{\text{obs}}) $$
- One-sided (e.g., $$ H_1: \mu < \mu_0 $$): $$ \text{p-value} = P_{H_0}(T \leq t_{\text{obs}}) $$
- Two-sided (e.g., $$ H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0 $$):
  - If the distribution of $$ T $$ under $$ H_0 $$ is symmetric:
  $$
  \text{p-value} = 2 \cdot P_{H_0}(T \geq |t_{\text{obs}}|)
  $$

  Or more generally:

  $$
  \text{p-value} = P_{H_0}(|T| \geq |t_{\text{obs}}|)
  $$

#### Example

Known population mean : $$ \mu\_0 = 170 $$  
Known population stdev : $$ \sigma = 10 $$  
Sample size : $$ n = 25 $$  
Sample mean : $$ x_bar $$ = 173  

$$ 
H_0 : \mu = 170, H_a : \mu != 170 
$$  
  
$$\begin{align}
Z &= X\_bar - \mu\_0 / \sigma/\sqrt(n) \\
&= (173-170) / 10/\sqrt(25) \\
&= 3/2 
&= 1.5
$$\end{align}

$$
P (Z >= 1.5) = 1- N(1.5) ~= 1-0.9332 = 0.0668
$$

$$
p-value = 2 * 0.0668 = 0.1336
$$

At significance level of 0.05, fail to reject the null hypothesis (p=0.1336 >0.05).

### t-stats, and unbiased estimation of sample standard deviation 

Sample standard deviation is given by:  
  
$$
s^2 = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

When the population standard deviation is unknown, then t-statistic is used.  
The test statistic for t-stats is given by: 
  
$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} \quad \text{(with \( n-1 \) degrees of freedom)}
$$

### Other examples tests 

#### Chi-Squared for categorical case
- Example: testing independence between variables in a contingency table:  

  $$
  \chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}
  $$
    
- This follows a **chi-squared distribution**, not normal.

#### Ordinal or non-normal data â†’ Use rank-based or non-parametric tests
- Wilcoxon signed-rank test Mann-Whitney U Kruskal-Wallis, etc.
- These use test statistics that follow specialized distributions, not normal.
