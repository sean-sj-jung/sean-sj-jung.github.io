### Hugging Face Agents-MCP Hackathon & Server-Sent Events (SSE) MCP

During the Gradio Agents & MCP Hackathon 2025, participants were challenged to build a Gradio app on Hugging Face Spaces and expose it as an SSE-compatible Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.  
I took this opportunity to develop the Financial Ratio Calculator: a lightweight tool that instantly computes the most widely used financial ratios from a company’s three statements.  
  
The calculator covers profitability, growth, operating efficiency, liquidity, and solvency metrics—providing analysts and developers with an easy entry point for automated financial analysis and SSE streaming demos.
